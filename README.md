A fullstack web app that ontains articles from the verge, users can specify topics and date ranges. 

React was for display and mongoDB to handle server database. 

### Running the App
If you would like to run this from your command line, then you would need to have react, and mongoDB installed in your computer.

If you do so, then it is as simple as running any other node application, following the yarn start pattern common for all react apps.

You can also run the app from your browser on the heroku version [here](https://apologetic-drake-56624.herokuapp.com/)
